# StardewValleyApplications
A bunch of programs or applications to help you with your Stardew Valley Run



### SDV_FriendshipApp
> Doesn't use cookies anymore. But uses localStorage instead.

This little application can be used to track your friendship with everyone.
It is a small .html file which can be run locally in your standard browser.
This Application uses html, JavaScript and CSS to bring you some functionality with a little bit of style.
Using the ingame sprites turned into Base64 strings to save everything in one file.

You can track friendship on the right side by clicking on/touching the hearts and also hide/show specific NPCs. Wether you still need them or just don't want to have them as your friends.
> ONCE YOU USE ANY OF THE FUNCTIONALITY THE FILE WILL STORE DATA IN YOUR BROWSERS LOCALSTORAGE!!!

When you open the page back up (with the same browser on the same device with your local storage for this page not deleted and the file still in the same spot) everything you saved last should* be reloaded.

\* if it isn't do not blame me. 

### Features
+ List all NPCs from the base game
+ Hide NPCs you don't need to see
+ Save your Friendship-Level for each NPC
+ Save data in your browsers local storage
+ Download data as CSV
+ Import data from CSV
+ Everything done without any connection to the internet! Everything local and in one file!

### TODO:
+ ~~function to clear eveything saved and start again (Next feature to be implemented... probably.)~~
+ ~~function to "download"<sup>1</sup> the saved state~~ **(Thanks VincentSteele)**
+ Rework of models to allow easy implementation of:
  + function to mark bachelor/ette NPC as Boyfriend/Girlfriend
  + function to mark bachelor/ette NPC as Husband/Wife
+ function to add your own NPC (wether for children or for custom NPCs from Mods)
+ data-popup on items (on mouseover for desktop and touch on mobile)
